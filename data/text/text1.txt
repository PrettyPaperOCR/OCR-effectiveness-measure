Abstract—Game AI competitions are important to foster re- search and development on Game AI and AI in general. These
competitions supply different challenging problems that can be
translated into other contexts, virtual or real. They provide
frameworks and tools to facilitate the research on their core
topics and provide means for comparing and sharing results. A
competition is also a way to motivate new researchers to study
these challenges. In this document, we present the Geometry
Friends Game AI Competition. Geometry Friends is a two-player
cooperative physics-based puzzle platformer computer game. The
concept of the game is simple, though its solving has proven to
be difficult. While the main and apparent focus of the game is
cooperation, it also relies on other AI related problems such as
planning, plan execution, and motion control, all connected to
situational awareness. All of these must be solved in real-time.
In this paper we discuss the competition and the challenges it
brings, and present an overview of the current solutions.

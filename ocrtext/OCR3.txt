motivate many researchers to work on difficult problems and
provide, at the same time, a framework for common ground to
contextualise and compare research. Also, competitions may
be used to support teaching of Game AI (and AI in general)
as they present very concrete problems for students to address
and, typically, share openly the submissions and results.

In this paper, we present the Geometry Friends Game AI
Competition [2] that runs around a physics based collaborative
puzzle-platformer game (Geometry Friends). Because of its
cooperative nature, the game promotes interesting AI chal-
lenges that are not often seen in game AI competitions. It
provides challenges of collaboration and team AI at different
levels. In the paper, we discuss some of the results obtained
so far and the implications and potential importance of the
competition for game AI research. We start by explaining the
Geometry Friends game in section III, after some discussion
of related work on competitions of game AI, in section II. In
section IV we enumerate the AI problems that can be explored
with the game. We then present the competition and framework
in the respective sections V and VI. Afterwards, we describe
briefly the solutions developed so far, in section VII, most of
which competed in previous competitions. Finally, we draw
some conclusions in section VIII and discuss future work.

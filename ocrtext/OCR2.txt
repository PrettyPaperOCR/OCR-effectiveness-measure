I. INTRODUCTION

Game Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for sev-
eral decades. Many computer games make use of AI, whether
to serve as the playersâ€™ opponents or allies, to create real-time
challenges by altering the environment or even generate entire
new levels. Although the main value of computer games is
entertainment, they can also be used to improve other aspects
of the real or virtual world. For example, some games have
educational value as well. Games based on vehicle simulators,
for instance, can teach and train piloting skills that players
can later apply in real-life. A similar approach could be used
with artificial autonomous agents. An agent that can pilot a
simulated car in a game, so it can be used as a rival to
the player, during a race, could later be used as a base for
self driving cars. It all depends on the level of detail of said
simulation, but in the end, this kind of development is done
with several steps of incremented complexity.

There is a wide variety of skills that games can teach.
Multiplayer games, for instance, can teach social skills. In
those games, players may find themselves competing against
other players or cooperating with them. While the competition
may focus more on the individual skills, cooperation allows
players to develop skills as team members.

Competitions of Game AI, similarly to other AI fields
[1], have been used frequently and successfully to foster the
development of new and innovative research. Competitions
